.gitignore file 


 Can add the files that you want git to ignore and NOT upload or make
 available to others from your github repo.

 Origin is the remote side of the repo.

 git add <filename, filenames....>

 To add files to git
 && git commit -m "CommitMESG"

 git rm -f <filename>

 To remove a file from git   th  -f is for "force"
 && git commit -m "CommitMESG"

 Need to have a commit mesg after each (adding or removing). &&
