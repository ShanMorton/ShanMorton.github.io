.gitignore file 


 Can add the files that you want git to ignore and NOT upload or make
 available to others from your github repo.

 Origin is the remote side of the repo.

 git add <filename, filenames....>
 To add files to git

 git rm -f <filename>
 To remove a file from git   the  -f is for "force"

 This line is to simulate a change done by another user.
